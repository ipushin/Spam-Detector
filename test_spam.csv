this article from URL has been sent to you by khare URL texas pacific in addition to its multibillion dollar portfolio detailed below actually does invest in promising new companies not just turnarounds it s just that knownow is waaay to small of a part of their NUMBER NUMBERb portfolio so far rohit khare URL texas pacific goes where others fear to spend august NUMBER NUMBER by riva d atlas and edward wong it was one of the first calls david n siegel placed when he became chief executive of the beleaguered us airways last march seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner and meaner business plan keep his planes flying and renegotiate costly contracts with the unions he flipped through his files and found the number for the texas pacific group an investment firm headed by david bonderman a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation for fixing problem companies mr siegel once a top executive at continental airlines had watched texas pacific s partners turn an investment of NUMBER million in the airline made three years after it filed for bankruptcy in NUMBER into a profit of more than NUMBER million and they had made nearly as much on their stake in america west which filed for bankruptcy in NUMBER that search for advice turned into an offer why not let texas pacific have a role in us airways revival asked richard schifter the texas pacific executive whom mr siegel reached in june mr siegel called mr schifter again and days before us airways announced its plans to file for bankruptcy two weeks ago but after it had negotiated about NUMBER million in concessions with its unions texas pacific based in fort worth and san francisco agreed to kick in NUMBER million as part of a NUMBER million loan to keep the company operating during bankruptcy it also agreed to buy NUMBER million of stock or NUMBER percent of the company and take NUMBER of NUMBER seats on the board if us airways emerges from bankruptcy unless another investor surfaces with a better offer one of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were said james coulter a partner at texas pacific in an interview after the bankruptcy filing there aren t many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry texas pacific which manages NUMBER billion thrives by buying businesses no one else wants mr coulter and mr bonderman made their names during the recession of the early NUMBER s with investments in continental and america west the firm s hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements now the partners are again looking for trouble in the last year alone texas pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions most in unloved industries like semiconductors reinsurance and airlines just last month it announced plans to buy burger king which has been losing market share for NUMBER NUMBER billion it is also bidding for bankgesellschaft berlin a large and troubled bank the most creative and potentially lucrative of these deals could be texas pacific s acquisition last november of memc electronic materials a semiconductor company for NUMBER yes just NUMBER in cash it will also guarantee a NUMBER million bank loan in the last few years most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts the use of junk bonds bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies have been largely inactive falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze texas pacific is different this is a terrific environment for them said stephen schwarzman chief executive of the blackstone group which also specializes in buyouts mark attanasio a managing director at trust company of the west which has invested with texas pacific said most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing you don t see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes like most other buyout firms texas pacific tries to keep its inner workings private its partners rarely grant interviews and its web site is perpetually under construction mr bonderman mr coulter and william price the third founding partner declined to be interviewed for this article mr bonderman NUMBER is known for his rumpled shirts and bright patterned socks he likes argyle socks and they tend to fall down around his ankles said henry miller an investment banker who advises troubled companies early in his career when he was a washington lawyer mr bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit when a texas pacific deal is being negotiated he is known for obsessively staying in touch even when he is trekking in places like pakistan nepal and most recently bhutan whenever i see a long unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller i d i know it s david calling said one investment banker who often works with mr bonderman mr bonderman made his reputation in the NUMBER s as the chief investment officer for robert bass the texas oilman mr bonderman enriched mr bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like american savings loan which had been seized by the government over nearly a decade mr bonderman s picks earned an average annual return of NUMBER percent for mr bass in NUMBER mr bonderman struck out on his own with mr coulter a former lehman brothers banker who had also worked for mr bass they teamed up later that year with mr price a veteran of ge capital capital and bain company a consulting firm to form texas pacific the three men have complementary skills investment bankers and other deal makers said mr bonderman is the master strategist and mr coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm s purchases mr price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues david is very much the optimist very much the deal maker said greg brenneman a former president of continental jim is very much a counterbalance to david he will sit back and ask the tough questions he will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than david does by the end of the NUMBER s texas pacific was well established in deal making it easily raised NUMBER NUMBER billion from pension funds and other investors in early NUMBER to celebrate their war chest the firm s partners rented san francisco s city hall and hired the b NUMBER s to play at a party but as the stock market began to tumble texas pacific hesitated for a NUMBER month stretch the partners made no deals they checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups including adelphia xerox and global crossing but stayed away finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable instead texas pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments taking more than NUMBER billion in profits during that stretch they started to cash out early in the cycle said mario giannini chief executive of hamilton lane a money management firm some of whose clients are texas pacific investors the good times of the late NUMBER s were not ideal for texas pacific it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help but texas pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough it revived oxford health plans the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid NUMBER s almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems in NUMBER it made a NUMBER million investment in ducati motor the italian motorcycle maker whose profits have since more than quadrupled but texas pacific also stumbled usually when it bought at the top of the market texas pacific s NUMBER million investment in the j crew group the clothing retailer for which it paid a steep price of NUMBER times cash flow in NUMBER has been a disappointment so has its NUMBER purchase of bally the shoe maker which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods texas pacific also lost more than NUMBER million on zilog a semiconductor company and favorite brands a candy maker both of which filed for bankruptcy some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm s performance texas pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade the first fund a NUMBER million portfolio raised in NUMBER and including investments made through march NUMBER should return more than NUMBER percent according to one texas pacific investor but its second fund NUMBER NUMBER billion raised in NUMBER could return less than half that this investor estimated since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank but because texas pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund profits on these investments could rebound it is hoping for example that with new management in place j crew will turn around as the economy rebounds in any case one competitor said their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won t return any capital to investors but with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble texas pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success the investor said they should do exceptionally well he said texas pacific has a distinct style if not formula it relies on talented self sufficient managers to restructure troubled companies preferring to remain hands off except for surveillance from the boardroom when necessary it replaces managers less than a year after continental emerged from bankruptcy for example mr bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend robert r ferguson the chief executive led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court continental s board where mr bonderman was chairman then brought in gordon m bethune an executive at boeing and in october NUMBER he replaced mr ferguson as chief executive mr bethune quickly did a top to bottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry the biggest conflict i ve ever seen was with bob ferguson said clark onstad a former general counsel for the federal aviation administration in describing the thinking of mr bonderman whom he has known since the NUMBER braniff bankruptcy he chose bethune over his longtime friend ferguson because he thought bethune would do a better job at america west texas pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul this time the charge was led by mr coulter and mr schifter both directors w douglas parker the current chief executive flew to mr coulter s home in san francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer they talked for hours and mr parker said the two men quickly realized they had somewhat kindred spirits the board replaced most senior managers at america west except william franke the chief executive who stepped down last september his restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in august NUMBER texas pacific owns just NUMBER percent of america west worth about NUMBER NUMBER million but those are controlling shares and the group holds more than NUMBER percent of the votes these are not passive investors nor am i said donald l sturm a denver businessman who serves on continental s board with mr bonderman and mr price you re active your money is at stake your reputation is at stake after overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at continental and america west texas pacific has a good reputation with labor that was one reason us airways was interested in a texas pacific investment said chris chiames a spokesman for the airline mr siegel wanted an investor who would be as labor friendly as possible mr chiames said but us airways can still entertain other bids this fall and marvin davis the billionaire investor from los angeles has expressed interest texas pacific s investment in burger king made with goldman sachs and bain capital was announced after two years of discussions among texas pacific s partners and the chain s franchisees even before the company which had been owned by diageo the liquor company was put up for sale said julian josephson chairman of the national franchisee association which represents most burger king franchisees we liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy mr josephson said many other owners he added are dismissive of labor at burger king texas pacific will also be working with an executive it knows burger king s chief executive is john dasburg the former chief executive of northwest airlines who met mr bonderman and his partners when northwest bought out their stake in continental in NUMBER unlike most buyout firms texas pacific remains enamored with the technology industry despite the failure of so many start ups the last two years it has focused on the semiconductor industry which like the airline industry is highly cyclical so far though results have been mixed the firm s NUMBER acquisition of the paradyne corporation which makes equipment for high speed internet connections has been a huge success texas pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late NUMBER s selling most of its stakes for NUMBER times its investment but a much larger investment its NUMBER million acquisition of zilog the chip maker in NUMBER was made just before the economic crisis in asia caused chip prices to plummet zilog filed for bankruptcy last year texas pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company on semiconductor which it acquired for NUMBER NUMBER billion three years ago it invested NUMBER million more last year its latest gamble on the industry the NUMBER deal for memc may prove the most lucrative the cost of mailing the payment to e on based in d sseldorf germany was actually more than the acquisition one executive close to the deal said texas pacific and its partners in the deal trust company of the west and leonard green partners agreed to guarantee a NUMBER million revolving line of credit texas pacific also assumed NUMBER million worth of debt most of which it swapped for more stock in the company they did a good job of timing the acquisition said nabeel gareeb the company s chief executive who noted that in the last quarter memc reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of NUMBER but texas pacific s interest in airlines is clearly sizable besides its involvement in continental america west and us airways the company plans to buy gate gourmet the catering business of the bankrupt swissair group two years ago texas pacific started a web based discount ticket service called hotwire it put up most of the NUMBER million in seed money then persuaded six airlines to invest with it said karl peterson the chief executive hotwire instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets as priceline does shows the cheapest ticket on its web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale the contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt hotwire which is privately owned mr peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that texas pacific remains committed to it last spring mr peterson met mr bonderman in aspen to talk about hotwire and to go snowboarding mr bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany hotwire down the steep internet chute but he does have his limits on risk mr peterson discovered before going down the mountain mr bonderman strapped on a helmet URL how to advertise for information on advertising in e mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the

 bottom line the late senate minority leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase but it is questionable that he ever coined it an interesting link courtesy of the harrow report there s no written evidence so far that senator everett dirksen is the source of the infamous quote attributed to him it s kind of astounding that there is enough general social consensus NUMBER of all queries makes it a very faq and eyewitness reporting without a single written source what the essay below doesn t seem to answer though is what the earliest attributed quote in print by any other writer is i d naturally be much more skeptical if the quote emerged after his death rk URL a billion here a billion there did dirksen ever say a billion here a billion there and pretty soon you re talking real money or anything very close to that perhaps not based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of the dirksen congressional center staffers there have found no evidence that dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than NUMBER percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations here is what they examined all of the existing audio tapes of the famed ev and charlie and ev and jerry shows all newspapers clippings in the dirksen papers about NUMBER NUMBER pages of dirksen s own speech notes transcripts of his speeches and media appearances transcripts of republican leadership press conferences and dirksen s statements on the senate floor as documented in the congressional record although dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech preferring to rely on notes he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase for example in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending dirksen would jot the word pothole to remind him to tell the following story on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling as i think of this bill and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole i am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street they had dug quite a number of holes when they got through they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole and they had a nice little mound which was quite a traffic hazard not knowing what to do with it they sat down on the curb and had a conference after a while one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said i have it i know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard we will just dig the hole deeper congressional record june NUMBER NUMBER p NUMBER on the same occasion dirksen relied on yet another spending story one he labeled cat in the well one time in the house of representatives a colleague told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy he said johnny a cat fell in a well NUMBER feet deep suppose that cat climbed up NUMBER foot and then fell back NUMBER feet how long would it take the cat to get out of the well johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while and then when the teacher came down and said how are you getting along johnny said teacher if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils i am pretty sure that in the next NUMBER minutes i can land that cat in hell if some people get any cheer our of a NUMBER billion debt ceiling i do not find much to cheer about concerning it congressional record june NUMBER NUMBER p NUMBER but there are no such reminders for the a billion here a billion there tag line as there surely should have been given dirksen s note making tendencies he spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling federal spending and the growth of government yet there is no authoritative reference to the billion phrase the chief evidence in support of dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him the library of congress for example cites someone s personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence the dirksen center has received calls from people who heard dirksen say those words some even providing the date of the event but cross checking that information with the records has so far turned up nothing in the way of confirmation the closest documented statement came at a joint senate house republican leadership press conference on march NUMBER NUMBER when dirksen said the favorite sum of money is NUMBER billion a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll a billion here a billion there emd papers republican congressional leadership file f NUMBER but the and pretty soon you re talking real money is missing in another close call the new york times january NUMBER NUMBER quoted dirksen look at education two and one half billion a billion for this a billion for that a billion for something else three to five billion for public works you haven t got any budget balance left you ll be deeply in the red cited in byron hulsey s everett dirksen and the modern presidents ph d dissertation may NUMBER university of texas p NUMBER of course the dirksen papers do not document completely the late senator s comments for example the center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees their collection of congressional records ends in NUMBER omitting the last four years of dirksen s life and career he might have employed the phrase only late although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career dirksen s campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts dirksen also held center stage before the video age meaning that many remarks particularly those in campaigns escaped capture bottom line the late senate minority

 a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than NUMBER a day is neither just nor stable absolutely correct perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa our new music and news channel for NUMBER NUMBER year old arabs it s NUMBER in practically every market it s entered nearing NUMBER listenership in amman and it s even beginning to be trusted for news well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the long term as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term many of you may disagree but i found the document below surprisingly centrist if you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re icc taiwan relations act etc but still this is as much a democratic platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might as you read replace united states with roman empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history i don t know how proud to be about that but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our NUMBER military installations overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us heck i d love to see a real time map of federal expenditures around the globe a softly glowing necklace of embassies carriers arctic research stations hotels golf courses warehouses libraries clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy of course this still doesn t leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the bush doctrine for pre emptive strikes i d sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world rohit september NUMBER NUMBER full text bush s national security strategy following is the full text of president bush s new national security strategy the document entitled the national security strategy of the united states will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administration s policy introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise in the twenty first century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedom loving people across the globe and across the ages today the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty by making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government today that task has changed dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies and as a matter of common sense and self defense america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action as we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war today the world s great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth in time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement finally the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world the events of september NUMBER NUMBER taught us that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the united states will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases in building a balance of power that favors freedom the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent for freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedom loving nations the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations the world trade organization the organization of american states and nato as well as other long standing alliances coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions in all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment freedom is the non negotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom s triumph over all these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission i overview of america s international strategy our nation s cause has always been larger than our nation s defense we fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER the united states possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom for most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality that great struggle is over the militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must defeat these threats to our nation allies and friends this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty the u s national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity and this path is not america s alone it is open to all to achieve these goals the united states will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century ii champion aspirations for human dignity some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER in pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property these demands can be met in many ways america s constitution has served us well many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us as a result america is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern europe between NUMBER and NUMBER or in belgrade in NUMBER when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty our principles will guide our government s decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies we will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non violently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends just three days removed from these events americans do not yet have the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing president bush washington d c the national cathedral september NUMBER NUMBER the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents in many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and al qaida but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america south america europe africa the middle east and across asia our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks however this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction wmd or their precursors defending the united states the american people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of self defense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism this includes using the full influence of the united states and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening america s homeland security to protect against and deter attack this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and mass casualty dangers our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic while our focus is protecting america we know that to defeat terrorism in today s globalized world we need support from our allies and friends wherever possible the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations as well as non governmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twenty first century iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts we build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small president bush berlin germany may NUMBER NUMBER concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states falter the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u s action direct or indirect is warranted we have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israeli palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of america s close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states and because of that region s importance to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine living beside israel in peace and security like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict the united states the international donor community and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary if palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine permanent occupation threatens israel s identity and democracy so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible palestinian state as there is progress towards security israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september NUMBER NUMBER and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them in south asia the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan s choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society the administration sees india s potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty first century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by indonesia that allows u s assistance to make a difference in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly mexico brazil canada chile and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope we will work with regional institutions such as the summit of the americas process the organization of american states oas and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere parts of latin america confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country in colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people in africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united states preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror american interests and american principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity together with our european allies we must help strengthen africa s fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats africa s great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa nigeria kenya and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and africa s capable reforming states and sub regional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in sub saharan africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent v prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER the nature of the cold war threat required the united states with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemy s use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war our security environment has undergone profound transformation having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world s strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make today s security environment more complex and dangerous in the NUMBERs we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes these states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands at the time of the gulf war we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq s designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become the world s principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well these states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmd armed adversaries strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs the recent g NUMBER agreement to commit up to NUMBER billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of today s threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option we cannot let our enemies strike first in the cold war especially following the cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo risk averse adversary deterrence was an effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations in the cold war weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose so called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action for centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today s adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would fail instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september NUMBER NUMBER mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy s attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world s most destructive technologies the united states cannot remain idle while dangers gather we will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions to support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough when nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively president bush monterrey mexico march NUMBER NUMBER a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america s shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including pro growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the well being and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity the lessons of history are clear market economies not command and control economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u s national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are japan s efforts to end deflation and address the problems of non performing loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners including through the group of seven g NUMBER to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty our long term objective should be a world in which all countries have investment grade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets we will work actively with other countries the international monetary fund imf and the private sector to implement the g NUMBER action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it this is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living to promote free trade the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy seize the global initiative the new global trade

opportunity and confidence in developing countries the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide market access for nearly all goods produced in the NUMBER countries of sub saharan africa we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union canada and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets protect the environment and workers the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into u s trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto and use the international labor organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the western hemisphere africa central asia and the caspian region we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate our overall objective is to reduce america s greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by NUMBER percent over the next NUMBER years by the year NUMBER our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic u n framework convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for u s cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of NUMBER NUMBER billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a NUMBER million increase over last year s budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure

all its citizens president bush washington d c inter american development bank march NUMBER NUMBER a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than NUMBER a day is neither just nor stable including all of the world s poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of u s international policy decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy working with other nations the united states is confronting this failure we forged a new consensus at the u n conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change this administration s goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world s poorest economies within a decade the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform we propose a NUMBER percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states while continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world s poor we have reversed the downward trend in u s contributions and proposed an NUMBER percent increase in the u s contributions to the international development association ida the world bank s fund for the poorest countries and the african development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world s poor when it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results for this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals thanks to u s leadership the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results and part of the u s contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans greater use of results based grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with ever larger debt burdens as a result of u s leadership the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education hiv aids health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks we will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hiv aids malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hiv aids organized by u n secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development only about NUMBER percent of world bank resources are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least NUMBER percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa the united states can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids continue to aid agricultural development new technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water using sound science the united states should help bring these benefits to the NUMBER million people including NUMBER million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power we have our best chance since the rise of the nation state in the NUMBERth century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war president bush west point new york june NUMBER NUMBER america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization nato which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter european security and the european union eu our partner in opening world trade the attacks of september NUMBER were also an attack on nato as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v self defense clause for the first time nato s core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances nato must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under nato s own mandate as well as contributing to mission based coalitions to achieve this we must expand nato s membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces if nato succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the same time we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come the attacks of september NUMBER energized america s asian alliances australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september NUMBER was an attack on australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world s finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack we have deepened cooperation on counter terrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand the war against terrorism has proven that america s alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and friendships we will look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longer term build on NUMBER years of u s australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asia pacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly russia india and china in all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twenty first century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive long term relations with the euro atlantic community and the united states russia s top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country s current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand increasingly that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russia s entry into the world trade organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the nato russia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia our european allies and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russia s growing commitment to integration into the euro atlantic community at the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russia s uneven commitment to the basic values of free market democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russia s very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that u s interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of india s nuclear and missile programs and the pace of india s economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asia pacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy china s leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asia pacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter terrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hiv aids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting village level elections yet remains strongly committed to national one party rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizen s needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from china s entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over NUMBER billion in annual two way trade the power of market principles and the wto s requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the self defense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september NUMBER NUMBER fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our long standing allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the long term these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform america s national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twenty first century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington d c joint session of congress september NUMBER NUMBER the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our military s highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against u s interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the world s most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold war era armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the u s commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the long distance deployment of u s forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing long range precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure u s access to distant theaters and protect critical u s infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting u s intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining near term readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or non state actor to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build up in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nation s foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with all source analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend america s interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with non governmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect u s nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u s personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond america s borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that energy that is where our national security begins ,0,0.0,0

washington the canadian government is considering a proposal that would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies a discussion draft URL released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every canadian with an internet account a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online the canadian government including the department of justice URL and industry canada URL wrote the NUMBER page blueprint as a near final step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance a proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in early NUMBER arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even run of the mill crimes they also claim that by enacting these proposals canada will be following its obligations under the council of europe s cybercrime treaty URL which the country is in the process of considering if the discussion draft were to become law it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses authorize police to order internet providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden electronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing in most circumstances a court order would be required for government agents to conduct internet monitoring canada and the united

rights activists and civil liberties groups of nearly NUMBER participating nations only albania has formally adopted URL or ratified the treaty michael geist URL a professor at the university of ottawa who specializes in e commerce law says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems weak it seems to me that the main justification they ve given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes geist said to me that s not a particularly convincing argument if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority make that case geist added that there s nothing in the document that indicates new powers are needed i don t know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data retention orders the united states has a similar requirement called the communications assistance for law enforcement act URL but it applies only to pre internet telecommunications companies it is proposed that all service providers wireless wireline and internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to

information center URL epic who specializes in international law says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers not just internet providers andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data epic opposes URL the cybercrime treaty saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends the establishment of a national database with personal information about

no analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet but here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xaNUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xgNUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xaNUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xaNUMBER is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first NUMBER bytes of a packet while the xaNUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBERu high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xaNUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may and earlier this month tarari an intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now available priced starting at NUMBER NUMBER the company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early NUMBER by eugene kuznetsov a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks long before industry interest in xml grew kuznetsov assembled a team of world class m i t engineers and designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing xml the first such solution was a software interpreter called dgxt this software based approach to xml processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own

intelligent xml networking devices capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions at the wire speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services and other xml centric initiatives datapower s solutions are based on its patent pending xml generation three xgNUMBER technology enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter and intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type datapower s xml acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of xml that is required to support next generation enterprise applications said eugene kuznetsov cto and founder of datapower technology datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s critical to web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance a single datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of NUMBER servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment in addition the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security protection against xml based denial of service attacks connection of e business protocols for incompatible xml data streams load balancing between back end servers and real time statistics reports in the post bubble economy technology investment decisions require laser focused scrutiny datapower s patent pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises said michael tyrrell of venrock associates by turbo charging their networks with datapower s unique xml aware networking technology companies will be free to adopt next generation web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and security said bill burnham of mobius venture capital datapower is on their third generation of technology

 URL the disappearing alliance by dale franks NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER for over two generations the countries of western europe have been our closest allies we stood beside each other through the darkest days of the cold war as partners in the north atlantic treaty organization we celebrated with them over the fall of the soviet empire and the liberation of eastern europe from the yoke of communism tragically a generation from now we may be bitter adversaries europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that hudson institute scholar john fonte has termed progressive transnationalism the key doctrines of this form of post communist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas among these are the deconstruction of nationalism the promotion of post nationalist ideas of citizenship i e a global citizenry a redefinition of democracy and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the united nations the european union itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by european nations is post democratic while there is a european parliament the eu s power resides mainly in the unelected european commission ec and its unelected president who face few limits to their power instead of a limited consensual form of government where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws the eu has an appointed oligarchic executive along with a large attendant bureaucracy whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense moreover the eu has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the eu s political elite both the ec and the european court of justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected eu member governments this is a step backward in europe s political development european criticism of america is on the rise and the european list of complaints about america is a long and growing one they dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation they hate the fact that our citizens own guns they despise the fact that we execute murderers they resent the fact that our economy is so large and that americans consume so much they also resent and fear the fact that we have the ability to project american power anywhere in the world on august NUMBER NUMBER adrian hamilton wrote a column in the uk s independent newspaper in which he identified the us as a rogue state who should be restrained perhaps by a european military invasion followed by a decade or so of occupation fortunately the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way european progressives view the us but rather because the impotence of european military power makes the idea of an invasion of the us literally fantastic at least for now despite the tongue in cheek nature of this editorial however the fact remains that america is increasingly viewed this way by the european intellectual and political elite the europeans actively desire a world where the united nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states because they have built such a system in europe they feel it s valid for the rest of the world america however is the biggest obstacle to such a system the europeans cannot understand why america places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited consensual and constitutional government than it does on compliance with international norms they view all departures from such norms as aberrant because the un member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms they assume that since the process is ostensibly legitimate the results must be as well the trouble with this idea of course is that it gives the views of non democratic authoritarian states the same weight as those of free democratic societies it sanctifies the process with no regard to the actual results thus they are unable to make any moral distinction between the us refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens and similar refusals from iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power our repeated references to the us constitution and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms are incomprehensible to them they assume therefore that our refusal is based on arrogance rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights none of this bodes well for the future of euro american friendship or cooperation if the europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism their criticism of the us will rise while their tolerance of our differences will fall obviously in such a political atmosphere the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase that thought is frightening enough even more frightening however is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism r a hettinga mailto rah ibuc com the internet bearer

friday michael why is it that people who consider voting in an election an inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message don t get me wrong i think this is the case people will go to see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to express their malice and discontent towards not only the present regime in america but also the corrupt empty shallow pantomime which cast them into power in reality today the voting that takes place via the act of consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth and dimpling the appropriate chad or some other such convoluted act of free democratic expression why because in america they believe in dollars dollars don t lie in practise they are the last frontier of truth in america universally accepted as expressions of fear desire passion and need compared to the swing of the almighty buck and jeb bush knows this a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning given that fact i modestly propose an entirely new though wholly logical extension to the current democratic system in place in america i propose we augment and effectively replace the electoral system with a political stock market we should accept that politicians are entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america and embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects their intent a politician should issue a constant number of shares dependent upon his tenure in government those shares should be traded on an open exchange say the g r e e d short of course for the global realists electoral exchange democratic politicians we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their ability to maintain office grows as the truth about their embezzling campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is revealed of course their fortunes will fall this represents an opportunity for the market forces those same forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal protest to voice their opinion on the quality of america s governance during the intervening four years between elections elections themselves will in effect become meaningless as they are now since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each and every congressman senator and presidential candidate just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc strom thurman strom news quotes was down NUMBER today on fears that his latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed services committee meetings until november this would provide rejuvenating content to the econo political news sector which has found post economic bubble coverage to be both tiresome and deoressing the establishment of this new stock exchange would of course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained it systems engineers who could after passing the electoral securities exam become floor traders this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their multi billion dollar campaigns the requirement for the support of legions of spin doctors permanent campaign managers and investor relations personnel would also create jobs perhaps even a new practice for ernst young arthur anderson et al insider trading scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary thus spreading her influence to politics dividends if there are any on record at the close of a politician s career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set union funds brokerages and even pump and dump houses could benefit from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the southeast and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social security bets where they really mattered investors who lose their retirement life savings and support could rest assured that they were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors although there s no way to protect any of these for worldcom like crashes ambitious inspired district attorneys could file criminal suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform expectations thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty instead they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves on the whole i believe the system could work i could certainly work as well as our beloved securities trading industry and given the american electoral system s success at effectively expressing the will of the people it certainly couldn t do any worse in the meantime mike i think i ll go see your movie and try to depose the president ian on wednesday october NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER NUMBER pm michael moore s mailing list wrote october NUMBER NUMBER my film bowling for columbine opens this friday dear friends fans and fellow evildoers i am very happy and excited to tell you that this friday october NUMBER my new film bowling for columbine will open in new york and los angeles it is i promise the last thing the bushies want projected on the movie screens across america this week the film is first and foremost a devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for profit and power and no one in all the advance screenings i have attended has left the theatre with anything short of rage i truly believe this film has the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do something this is not good news for junior and company not when they are trying to drag us into another war not when a crazed sniper is exercising his constitutional right to own a high powered rifle not when john ashcroft is still prohibiting the fbi from looking through the gun background check files to see if any of the NUMBER hijackers or their associates purchased any weapons prior to NUMBER NUMBER because that we are told would violate these terrorists sacred second amendment rights yes i believe this movie can create a lot of havoc but i will need all of you to help me do this are you game last february NUMBERth i wrote to tell you about a book i had written and how the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to publish anything critical of bush after NUMBER NUMBER i appealed to you to save stupid white men from the shredder and to go out and buy it i promised you would not regret it and that the book would not only be a great read but an important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of george w bush within NUMBER hours the book went to NUMBER on the amazon best seller list by the fifth day the book was already into its NUMBERth printing the publisher was torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money greed won out and this sunday the book enters its NUMBERst week on the new york times best seller list and its NUMBERnd printing this is all because of you my crazy and loyal friends you made this happen against all the odds now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work bowling for columbine it s a movie that many critics have already called my best film to date they may be right it is certainly the most provocative thing i have ever done i have spent three years on it and i have to say it cuts deeper harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles and then in NUMBER more cities next week how it does in these first ten cities will determine whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it that is the nutty way our films are released if it doesn t have a big opening weekend you can kiss the film good bye therefore this weekend this film must be seen by millions of americans can you help me make that happen bowling for columbine is not a film simply about guns or school shootings that is only the starting point for my NUMBER hour journey into the dark soul of a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of violence both at home and around the world with this movie i have broadened my canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the NUMBERst century a nation that seems hell bent on killing first and asking questions later it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and terrorism against our own poor and how we have created a culture of fear that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore and it s a devastating comedy this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts no film has ever said the things i am saying in bowling for columbine i expect to be attacked i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of retribution i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many to swallow this is why i need your help movies live or die based on what happens at the box office the first weekend of its release i need you if you live in the new york or l a area to go see bowling for columbine this friday and saturday and take as many family members and friends with you as possible i guarantee you will not be disappointed and you may just see one of the best films of the year monday night in times square bowling for columbine had its premiere the crowd was amazing as it was this past saturday night at the chicago film festival the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line the hate mail the threats the promises of retribution have already started to roll in to the distributor of this movie united artists they are not backing down but how long will this last i need all of you in the new york tri state and southern california areas to go see bowling for columbine this weekend the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when it comes to your town a strong opening not only means that the rest of america will see this film it means that a good number of people who see it are going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved if it does poorly i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the movie i want to make next a film about NUMBER NUMBER and how bush is using that tragic day as a cover for his right wing agenda don t let that happen don t let the nra have one more success by stopping the wider distribution of this movie and together let us not remain silent in our opposition to bush s phony war against iraq if you live in new york you can see it at the lincoln plaza the sunshine and the loews NUMBERth st in l a you can catch it at the sunset NUMBER the westwood regent laemmle sunset laemmle towncenter encino landmark rialto pasadena and regal university irvine also please forward this to your other friends and tell them to go see bowling for columbine this weekend and finally don t miss our new website URL thank you for your help with this i feel so honored and privileged to

 begin pgp signed message hash shaNUMBER thugs of south boston and the revenge of the bandit princess the geodesic economy robert a hettinga sunday august NUMBER NUMBER boston when you think about it one way the fbi winter hill vs patriarcha angiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs put crudely and at its most racist the fbi and the winter hill gang were the mostly irish thugs and patriarcha s family were of course the mostly italian thugs think scorsese s upcoming gangs of new york only with counter reformatory overtones hoover s south boston social club putsch starting in the mid NUMBER s was particularly audacious in hindsight the u s federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibition era capture of the nation s rackets by the italians from the irish the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york but for south boston the most irish place in the us only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all the result as we all found out wasn t swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone hoover was posthumously swapping it for oxycontin or crystal methamphetamine or more properly pcp the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulger s crack cocaine era reign of boston s drug markets like the identical fbi sponsored reigns or violent horror by other also rans in cities across the us as a whole went up whole orders of magnitude not mere percentage points as stalin said once quantity has a quality all it s own and make no mistake j edgar hoover was directly responsible that quality of carnage nation wide so yes on paper at least it really was just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another and the result was on paper at least business as usual same stuff different century with apparently decent people like mr salvati URL accidently ground on the gears of justice like so much hamburger however to be much more macabre about it that hamburger was greasing if you will an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love a perfectly functioning market legislated out of existence on paper if nowhere else by government fiat and the back door but still elitist will to power of h l mencken s famous bluenoses and busybodies it all starts like all true evil does from the most innocent of beginnings what she couldn t do to alcohol teatotaling mrs grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller manageable demand the bloody result was like nine more heads of the hydra an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition in more markets and for more things as the NUMBERth century wore on every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive or harmful or physically distasteful or carcinogenic or now apparently fattening and then prohibited exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years a larger market than before the prohibition hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newly legislated barriers to competition imposed on them by the state increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances and finally the ultimate in evil the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end increasingly coercive axe handle beatings by our own government of the sacred liberty of the average but now unavoidably law breaking citizenry as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago you don t need government if nobody s breaking the law in some twisted corollary to parkinson s law governments to survive need more people breaking more laws or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time and to bring us back to the point david friedman would probably echo here his father milton s famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market and never the consumer much less the economy as a whole even especially if those sellers are breaking the law as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us and there absent the apparent grace of mr hoover went mr salvati in fact hayek himself in the road to serfdom couldn t have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoover s blatant imposition for our own good of vietnam era statist power at the neighborhood level and furthermore stalin couldn t have had better useful idiots than hoover did and neither by an absolutely literal extension did whitey bulger after hoover useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle idiots who were eating out of hoover s power craven hand for the entire middle of the NUMBERth century and whitey bulger s hand whether they knew it or not until the end of the millennium a time you ll notice which saw the increasingly steady imposition of mob violence and market control from both state and illegal interests way beyond the imaginings of even the most power mad rum running stock kiting movie flopping bureau pumping nazi appeasing irish bostonian little caesar or as for that matter his safely trust funded and now strictly political descendents in terms of actual financial economics think of what happened to mr salvati and the others dead or alive as a transfer price in human lives of the inevitable consequence of macnamara style vietnam era keynesian social cost input output accounting at its most despicable and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover and his co religionists in state economic control in the name of what really was as you ll now agree just a race war between thugs up in boston this shouldn t be a surprise really all race wars are at least fought by thugs though they re usually conceived elsewhere and endorsed at the time by all the right people for all the right reasons as far as the fbi itself goes remember mancur olson s observation that a prince is just a stationary bandit though given his penchant for women s clothing for other men and what s actually obscene for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference i suppose we can call j edgar hoover a bandit princess instead bandit queen of course would be a grievous insult to queens and real bandits everywhere cheers rah URL pagewanted print position top the new york times august NUMBER NUMBER hoover s f b i and the mafia case of bad bedfellows grows by fox butterfield boston aug NUMBER it was march NUMBER in the early days of j edgar hoover s war against the mafia f b i agents say congressional investigators eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of new england s organized crime boss raymond patriarca two gangsters joseph barboza and vincent flemmi wanted mr patriarca s permission to kill a small time hoodlum edward deegan as they were having a problem with him according to an f b i log of the conversation patriarca ultimately furnished this o k the f b i reported and three days later mr deegan turned up dead in an alley shot six times it was an extraordinary situation the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well known gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved but when indictments in the case were handed down in NUMBER the real killers who also happened to be informers for the f b i were left alone four other men were tried convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder though they had had nothing to do with it one joseph salvati who spent NUMBER years in prison filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the f b i for NUMBER million for false imprisonment his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the f b i the justice department and some f b i agents growing out of the tangled corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the f b i s boston office in its effort to bring down the mob the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light including documents detailing conversation in which mr patriarca approved the murder they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform which has pressured the department into turning over records about the f b i in boston the documents show that officials at f b i headquarters apparently including mr hoover knew as long ago as NUMBER that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution j edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself said vincent garo mr salvati s lawyer he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants mr barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr salvati and may have implicated him because mr salvati owed NUMBER to a loan shark who worked for mr barboza asked about the documents showing that mr hoover knew of mr salvati s innocence when he was put on trial gail marcinkiewicz a spokeswoman for the f b i in boston declined to comment citing the pending litigation a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office in one of the first results of the investigation one retired agent john j connolly is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were f b i informers james bulger and stephen flemmi vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers the government reform committee led by representative dan burton republican of indiana has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureau s knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr barboza were involved in killing mr deegan a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime including who fired the first shot then on june NUMBER NUMBER mr hoover s office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer in a reply five days later the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr patriarca potentially could be an excellent informant the agent also informed mr hoover that mr flemmi was known to have killed seven men and from all indications he is going to continue to commit murder nevertheless the agent said the informant s potential outweighs the risk involved a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmi s murders the director does not even respond the investigator said there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia which he had largely ignored in boston f b i agents recruited mr barboza and mr flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization the winter hill gang led by mr bulger both sides got what they wanted according to the investigations and the trial of mr connolly the f b i got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families which controlled organized crime in new england mr bulger s gang was able to take over the rackets in boston sell drugs and even commit murder while the f b i looked the other way one reason the f b i may not have used its information about mr patriarca s involvement in the deegan murder congressional investigators say is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence r i headquarters the f b i agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants to disguise the use of the device the investigators say mr salvati a former truck driver now NUMBER had his sentence commuted in NUMBER by gov william f weld last year while he was still on parole his murder conviction was dismissed by a massachusetts state judge after the justice department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison their survivors have joined the fourth man peter limone in a NUMBER million lawsuit against the justice department mr limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair his life was spared only when massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in NUMBER mr salvati lives in a modest apartment in boston s

hi everybody i m writing a web application in java tomcat jsp servlets database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is e commerce but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption decryption the api that i m using is the jca jdkNUMBER NUMBER x and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object and store in the database but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesn t really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list something i thought that can be of bit interest but probabily wrong and insecure after all i m a real beginner in secure programming and i m here to learn methods and technics first of all i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat so it is not shared with other web services or worst the nobody user that has no shell login but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signature rmi whatever else that the source is the right one and handle all the database connections or give the db connection password to the main web application in this way we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories and also an attacker should get root bean user account to read data this is not perfect and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means really another server running in the background any suggestions thank you mario torre please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments see URL ,0,8.569023033978101e-75,0

california s response confusion lawsuits and policy tweaks hasn t been sufficient more unfortunately even if the state suddenly did all the right things including a hard nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers grips we would need a willing federal partner but it s foolish to think that the bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional non renewable energy sources if the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early NUMBER that s a reasonable approach but don t expect miracles state policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation meanwhile instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices state laws and regulations put the utilities back in the business of buying energy

takeover of the utilities tempting but a bad idea when there s genuine competition as we could achieve in electricity generation the private sector tends to do a better job instead of abandoning deregulation california should find a way to inject real competition into the market we do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization at least under current conditions smart regulation is essential but the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control there are two ways conservation and replacement we need more of both the

and other renewable sources several power companies are expected to do this even sooner but this law has an element of old line thinking the captive customer model we need to be getting away from not

harder to disrupt electricity to homes and businesses this technology is coming along fast state policies are not keeping pace investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all california should be doing more to encourage this whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low income households california hasn t done badly on conservation in a general sense and energy customers did react to last year s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back but it s lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether maybe this is all pointless the bush administration s energy policies so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil coal and nuclear are making us all more vulnerable never mind what might happen if the coming war in iraq goes badly it s pointless to hope for a sane federal policy a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen based energy system but the largest state one of the world s

menu is an ongoing struggle but well worth it on most modern keyboards there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys otherwise ctrl esc always works menu NUMBER gives me a new command prompt in my work directory menu p n runs netscape NUMBER for compatibility testing in my day job ugh mozilla and emacs are almost always open but i quit lesser used applications as soon as i m done using them mostly because my laptop doesn t have a lot of memory i install cygwin NUMBER so that the

don t use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames i also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to NUMBER x NUMBER almost full screen at NUMBER x NUMBER and screen buffer size to NUMBER x NUMBER set window position at NUMBER x NUMBER and don t let the system position the window in mozilla i set my home page to about blank set internet search to search

set my home page to the page to edit my weblog since that s the only thing i do in internet explorer alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pgup pgdown between tabs within mozilla since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible i use emacs locally and vi remotely because the default behavior of emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable for instance editing a cgi script named foo cgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foo cgi backup file which is world readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks try this sometime on your favorite web site among other things my emacs file which is actually called _emacs on windows instructs emacs to store all backup files in a single directory d backup to treat all xml files as docbook all cgi scripts as python and all sql scripts as pl sql to use cygwin s bash shell for m x shell to use a single maximized frame with no menubar titled as the name of the current file to show column numbers to accept y and n for yes no questions not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when i press m w i use some weird

i like this part sounds like httpd on the client URL once the client component is installed a server can order a program to run on the client any cgi script java servlet asp component etc could be run on the client this is like breaking the web server into two parts originally web servers just understood http and sent pages then the field started demanding more from the web and the servers got loaded down with cgi and mod_perl and active pages and stuff so now the web server can choose to go back to simple serving and where the application is appropriate let the client do the other razzamatazz this is superior to javascript in one important detail the program doesn t have to reload when a new page is loaded as javascript functions do and because xdegrees uses web compatible technology users can access xdegrees resources without installing any software simply by using their browser scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a new naming and searching system ceo michael tanne claims to have figured out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers xdegrees will colocate servers at key routing points as akamai does and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default home server enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in house applications files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the internet as with napster or freenet in fact the caching in xdegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems users with high bandwidth connections can download portions or stripes of a file from several cached locations simultaneously the xdegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original a key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file which is stored as an http header for the file ,0,2.2956330452521645e-61,0

i did something crudely along those lines for vms vax maybe NUMBER years ago there is at least one product that does it for pc though i don t recall its name it is also handy for cases where you have a cd image of some filesystem or some other image of a filesystem that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept or is not graceful readonly storage it is also more or less necessary if you want to work with worm file structures which are older still there have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early NUMBERs if not before a generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem the written information must obviously be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage a device level implementation is however perfectly adequate it does not of course distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not if you truly know a device or perhaps a partition must not be written it can be simpler to either return error on writes or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments i have not tried it on extfNUMBER or reiser btw think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raidNUMBER or raidNUMBER i would contend that with cheaper storage these days it makes little sense to use raid save for shadowing and possibly striping those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold NUMBER gigs and up why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write sometimes of raid glenn everhart original message from bmord URL mailto bmord URL sent tuesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to webappsec securityfocus com secprog securityfocus subject use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list URL could this basic concept be used to easily make self fixing client server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production client server systems are layered for example your basic web application might have a web server running apache connected to an application server running some jNUMBERee or net business logic connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for say swap space but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system they will probably change an image that shouldn t be changed e g they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal because it is only deleting data rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this base redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid allowing for greater performance reliability and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don t yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardware separation of volatile and non volatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations only it would be more efficient and involve less or no downtime thanks for any opinions ben this transmission may contain information that is privileged confidential and or exempt from disclosure under

marshall islands in the north pacific however the marshall islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations comment just because the rmi government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of enenkio does that make it true why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized and documented time and again for fraud abuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government namely the dom and sister nation the kingdom of enenkio the marshallese name for wake island comment nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak for dom but as for the kingdom we don t even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign his majesty king remios the sovereign of enenkio and eneen kio atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore correction the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for dom claiming to represent the mid pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france presse comment the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio who are forced to live in exile from eneen kio atoll lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps NUMBER years furthermore an article in agence france presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government my preceding comments apply the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an investment scam we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio but also will positively impact people around the globe in fact we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation comment the kingdom of enenkio has made no fraudulent claims of which i am aware and in my post i am responsible for all published information i would personally caution any countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of nations companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect however my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source furthermore the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over NUMBER NUMBER of the land in the marshall islands including recent attempts to sequester him against his will we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism a honolulu based attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in the early NUMBERs comment mr moore is not an attorney though he was living in honolulu in the early NUMBERs correction the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the owner of eneen kio atoll a k a enen kio halcyon disclerta wake and NUMBER NUMBER other names iroijlaplap murjel hermios who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls he passed away in december NUMBER and was fully recognized by the rmi government he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in NUMBER whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen kio atoll ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel sic hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf correction the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made possible by murjel s appointment of mr robert moore the adopted brother of hermios alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen to the post of minister plenipotentiary the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios and the people s behalf the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed comment since when is a special power of attorney an agreement the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen kio atoll which lies over NUMBER miles north of lawful rmi boundaries the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen kio atoll because the atoll by any name you choose was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in NUMBER nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act law mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen kio and any statement to the contrary is false fraudulent and irresponsible finally i suggest you as a journalist or publisher do a little more research not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio but into the prehistoric history

further more melchizedek dom is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the NUMBERth day of september NUMBER but it did not convey a lease of land it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments however a prior agreement signed in may NUMBER which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio transferred mr robert moore s rights to develop taongi from mr moore to dom it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence this was made possible because mr moore is the alab one class of landowner of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll from the principal landowner iroijlaplap paramount chief murjel hermios who was aware of and supported the transaction consideration if any under the agreement was personally retained by mr moore who is also the adopted brother of hermios now please understand that while mr moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf and that of the future use and

the western pacific correction in NUMBER the united states invaded wake island the northernmost atoll actually named eneen kio centuries before western explorers arrived of the ratak chain of marshall

marshalls became a u s trust territory the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that wake island was a part of the marianas chain and pressed their historical claims to the atoll

here the u s government has consistently ignored these claims correction the u s government has consistently ignored claims from the marshall islands government which failed to exert a claim during

congress in NUMBER acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by americans of the republic of hawai i correction the eneen kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the u s congress when in NUMBER they acknowledged the illegality of the NUMBER overthrow of the monarch of the kingdom of hawai i by a group of american businessmen and u s marines and in the following year returned the island of kaho olawe to the hawaiian people king murjel hermios who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern marshalls declared wake island s independence in NUMBER correction king murjel hermios who was paramount chief until his death in december NUMBER declared the sovereign state of enenkio in NUMBER whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen kio atoll ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy the author responds i will make the necessary corrections here the marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence in return for his services as minister plenipotentiary in the united states hermios granted american businessman robert moore land on taongi atoll in the northern marshalls which moore has declared the dominion of melchizedek correction after the death of the first monarch his brother remios succeeded to the throne as second

not healed thus a current state of adversity exists following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island the government of enenkio on behalf of the marshallese king issued the state of war a declaration and broadcast it to the world the people were displaced from their native

the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief king murjel hermios in retrospect the declaration has had little visible effect while a state of adversity does exist the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of

government of the kingdom of enenkio we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the marshall islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be

natural marshallese supremacy can be re establish there as to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge we say let the issue be played

constitution of enenkio which can be seen at our web site URL referencing the news article in the marshall islands journal entitled kingdom of enenkio sets up in new zealand of may NUMBERst the editor

contrary our foreign ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter you are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an enenkio passport that such an act is patently illegal the published statement the group claims to represent iroijlaplap murjel hermios and the atolls of the ratak chain is wholly false i have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our internet site to refute the statement the kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries as the ratak atolls surely are contrary to their libelous statements the kingdom of enenkio was not created by robert moore and he is not a honolulu based attorney hm king murjel hermios is

assigned names of westerners who visited them wake wilkes and peale few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll eneen kio lived in the marshall islands exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site by way of developing the atoll as a nation the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to wake atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people the united states of america began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition

official march NUMBER declaration sent to top u s officials the kingdom of enenkio has acknowledged that a virtual state of war now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression

the federal seizure of islands in the north pacific ocean by the united states calls to end u s operations vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the kingdom have fallen on deaf ears despite repeated notices letters and legal advertising all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the united states government inaugural issue the gold stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears for that reason the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency however the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold the extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world note stamps are printed on paper stock do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money closing comments the government of the kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the kingdom of enenkio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the pacific region in doing so it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the state of war with the federal government of the united states and asks that everyone with

including selected cabinet members the document asserts that a state of war exists over the kingdom of enenkio atoll by way of acts by the federal government of the united states this is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government one of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a congressional investigation into the true events and factors

arrogance and human rights violations by the united states the land in question commonly called wake island is comprised of three small islands wake wilkes and peale named by western explorers for western persons what of the native discoverers the crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the northern ratak atolls of marshall islands the united states seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in NUMBER and again inNUMBER historical records reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships en route to the philippines on war missions and subsequent congressional action were the sole basis of the u s claim the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east such a station was never established at wake island it was destined to become a military installation however formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u s president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed but since the u s abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and germany was defeated in the first world war the objections fell into oblivion it is understood from written accounts of oral marshallese culture and traditions that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued the u s did not establish a settlement there until under a lease in NUMBER the caa predecessor of the faa allowed pan american airways to build a base for its fleet of trans pacific seaplanes clearly the so called annexation by the u s is grossly flawed the occupation patently illegal and its ownership is held therefore to be wholly invalid when the u s congress apologized for the overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy in NUMBER and the u s navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the natives of hawaii a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of wake island the islands of eneen kio as the northernmost atoll in the ratak chain played a very significant role in the culture and religion of micronesians living in the more hospitable islands of the marshall group while not being used for navy target practice as kaho olawe was the use of the islands of eneen kio atoll and the military mission at wake airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy devoid of scrutiny oversight or quintessential knowledge by the american public even after cultural intervention in the mid NUMBERs by christian missionaries natives continued to use eneen kio authority to go there being issued by the ratak iroijlaplap paramount chief king murjel hermios holds that title today by way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to wake island the u s cannot produce a title the hermios ancestral lineage passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers who gave the atoll its marshallese name their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership upon the basis of events and actions by the united states the administration of the kingdom of enenkio by virtue of the declaration yields to the recognition that a state of war exists over the island nation this is not however to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender sovereignty and independence of the kingdom over all other claims is forthrightly reasserted the belief is that truth and law is on the side of the kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of u s ownership and occupation native north americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights in the declaration demands are made as follows to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said state of war if unwilling to voluntarily negotiate

NUMBER fully disclose to the people of the united states u s strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen kio atoll by king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions disregard for human rights protected under international law united nations charter and conventions and the u s compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century note u s apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island kaho olawe also of religious significance has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens parting shot what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general the u s federal government more precisely which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe but considering its present source it is downright alarming it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years letters reports forms published articles press releases legal notices documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u s federal government our not too distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of manifest destiny which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago if this current trend signifies a resurgence it can only be considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record of american attempts at fixing up the world the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen kio atoll pre dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor people have a right to know the media a responsibility to show them in conclusion i reiterate that our focus from my point of view is one not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u s political philosophy and military prowess but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past supporting restoration of human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god given individual rights thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry top of page november NUMBER NUMBER news release in a bid to regain occupation of that

right mike i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eye s which can instantly share what they see amongst each other that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on their phones or that people will spend more time w images than voice just that it is fundamental from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses

communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous i d guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day i d have a different opinion of this i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made how many people do you know who communicate by pictures sure it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i don t buy it for most messages text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism for some messages pictures do the job but i would say not nearly as often as words why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about NUMBER hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didn t take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle again this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just don t understand kids today and they ll run with this i wasn t saying that mms wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t easy i was saying that i couldn t see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications i m looking for the compelling reason even if it s a stupid one why people would want to do this sure if they integrate cameras into the phone and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people but mostly i don t see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone s email address or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i don t think NUMBER hour photos are trivial people want to see their own pics right away and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots that s one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on the instant view part i m guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view but also instant show which is what this service offers i m not convinced that most people want instant show i think people like to package their pictures and show them that s why people put together fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture sure occasionally instant show is nice but it s just nice on occasion i still can t see how it becomes a integral messaging method what s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another there has to be some benefit even if it s silly if people are going to flock to it

 i have translated the article in full see end of post i think that i ve done a far better job than the google translation at least it s readable now any corrections appreciated stuff in s is my and others additions to the debate my apologies if i ve paraphrased anybody incorrectly i will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed the article makes four main points NUMBER absence of critical clauses in this case the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn t specify under what country s law the gpl is governed NUMBER specification in english only that for the end user as opposed to businesses the gpl doesn t apply because it s not written in french NUMBER arbitary licence change the point here is that under french law the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily this is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long where to whom dates and times in the absence of such limitations the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim david neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all copyright holders that s not my understanding french law allows a gpl type licence _on condition_ that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear if they are not there is nothing to stop the original author taking back his work the lawyers see this correctly imho as a weakness in the gpl NUMBER hidden defects roughly this clause means that the author s is are liable for any defects if the consumer is not an it engineer so if linux blows up and data is lost then the authors are liable ciaran johnson says that m oft and others have similar clauses the point here is that they are _all_ invalid just that this one affects the gpl also niall o broinn makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a service leasing arrangement and that s why it doesn t come under this point i would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software sales even if no money changes hands as governed very much by consumer law in france anyway rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default see the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified under french law the fact that two ip lawyers in france think that the gpl is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract NUMBER roughly there may be other reasons under french law why the gpl may be invalid whole article freedom a is worth more than these imperfect licences specialised lawyers look at the gpl lawyer cyril rojinsky duly appointed to the court and the jurist vincent grynbaum both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the free licences and in particular the gpl they have published their study in the review proprietes intellectuelles intellectual property NUMBER and their conclusion is grim their approach is interesting the problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under french law for them the question is a moot point but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences and in particular the gpl the problem is not free programmes but rather the licence contracts of free programmes absence of critical clauses the authors tell us that first of all the reference to copyright is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the internet the idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another this is why under international contracts it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring french law american c the authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point qpl ibm public licence and the mozilla public licence specification in the english language next the authors remind us that at least in france no clause in a contract may be contrary to french law NUMBER however it turns out that a licence such as the gpl is contrary to french law in several respects firstly it is written in english and the fsf doesn t officially approve translations the toubon law obliges this sort of contract to be written in french including for businesses since the notion of user applies not only to consumers but also to businesses professionals c contacted by the editors of linuxfrench lawyer cyril rojinsky declared that as far as business is concerned the toubon law is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of european directives on the subject but whatever about that the problem is still valid for individuals and while waiting for it french law to change french companies have to deal with it since it is the law of the land a programme under the gpl can suddenly change licence another problem much more serious is that according to french law the author of a free programme can at any time invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence in effect the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act i e the licence and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees and also with respect to its location i e where such rights may be excersised and duration of any such grants NUMBER this is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licences briefly this means that in france or elsewhere if the author is french that which is under the gpl could revert to proprietary from one day to the next the problem of the guarantee hidden defects an other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee the gpl licences and others show that the software is delivered without guarantee you are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts and this is correct however whatever is written in a licence contract one cannot free oneself from the guarantee from hidden defects since it is imposed in the civil code this concept is poorly understood by the layman it protects the buyer whoever it may be individual or business since it specifies the civil code and not consumer protection law against hidden defects deliberate or made in good faith by the seller for example if one buys a pair of socks in a sale and the shop has a notice specifying that sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it several scenarios are possible you could have checked the socks before purchase the flaw is deemed obvious and you can sing for your money you couldn t check the socks they were packaged for example and in this case despite the notice neither refund nor exchange you may invoke hidden defect and have them changed or obtain a refund it s up to you personally i have already invoked in shops the hidden defect clause and it always worked well shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the civil code the concept of hidden defect is rather wide it is necessary that you hadn t the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then according to the civil code that you wouldn t have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect the third case which is much rarer is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect hidden but didn t inform you in this case not only does he have to reimburse the product but all expenses incurred by the sale metro tickets to go to the shop the fuse which blew when you plugged it in c this idea of hidden defect applies to all products including programmes this was made abundantly clear by the authorities and the courts surrounding yNUMBERk this is particularly inconvenient for free programmes since a site which offers a linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky if in the case of a free programme one could speak about a hidden defect since the source code was available he replied actually concerning the guarantee the question of obvious defect will arise this analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an it professional or not opensource has this advantage over the proprietary programme it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an it person but for distribution to the public at large the problem remains the same roughly speaking lawyer cyril rojinsky said it himself this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored during this interview we asked ourselves for example about the fragility of the gpl clause which forbids linking source code under the gpl with proprietary code in effect the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme if for that i need to link with a proprietary library communication protocol device driver i may consider as null and void this clause of the gpl the conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community freedom merits more than these shoddy licences which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort NUMBER une publication de l institut de recherche en propriété intellectuelle noNUMBER juillet NUMBER NUMBER une telle clause de contrat qui est opposée à ce que dit la loi française est qualifiée en terme juridique de clause réputée non écrite c est à dire qu on fait comme si cette clause n était pas écrite dans le contrat

dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degree in anything actually useful much less a terminal one which means i m broker than anyone on this list it s just that you of all people lots with educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and economics is not a zero sum game the cost of anything including ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case intelligence and effort i will however admit to being educated waay past my level of competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you apparently its interesting but in this part of the world nova scotia a recent study found that college graduates earn less than graduates of NUMBER year community colleges trade schools they did decline to mention that the demand for some trades is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in just for the record the average salary for a university graduate including advanced degree holders here is c NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER us no wonder half of san francisco has set up here we have a whole whack of call centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years i think they hire some entry level it people for around NUMBER NUMBER us an hour which of course fits perfectly for me my entry level job in NUMBER paid NUMBER NUMBER an hour the fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are unionized in other words in this part of the world for the vast majority of people union dues are a better investment than tuition the counter argument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere but the counter counter argument is that we are the thin edge one of several really prison labor in the us would be another of third world wages and work practices coming to north america i worked at a company that had a NUMBER year wage freeze the fact that they could maintain that and prosper just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world i met many people there like me who felt that was fine i can vote with my feet they didn t quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar or worse policies anyway eventually they started a union drive during the vote retired employees were brought in by the employer rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here a bottle of rum and somehow allowed to vote the union filed a grievance which was denied by a minister of labour who hey guess what used to be a vp at the company that s free labor markets at work the business continues to prosper as i was told when i was there it is a cash cow as long as the joa joint operating agreement with the competing paper is in place and if you think that any of those wonderful american companies out of some free enterprise belief in competing for the best talent are going to do anything about that sorry most of them received generous subsidies in return i m sure for an understanding about the labor markets here btw if we ever actually had free markets in this country including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes all those smart people in the forbes NUMBER would have more money and there would be more self made people on that list in addition most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it not even relatively speaking finally practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress for those of you in the people s republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff cheaper over time a terrible petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or you d know about it by now in economic terms it s also called an increase in general welfare and no virginia i m not talking about extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time much as i like to accept what you say i do believe in free markets i have difficulty finding any except of course for labor markets which governments go to great lengths to protect well unless the supply is tight it was a great run with the technology industry producing most of the self made billionaires on the list but now we ve got a government sponsored monopoly and the concept of more stuff cheaper which it has always promised seems to be disappearing a particularly galling example is high speed internet access an article i read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricing approaches of the it industry cheaper better or you die and the telecom industry maintain your monopoly through regulation and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators meet sadly to say the telecom industry seems to have won the whole entertainment industry riaa palladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few in short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not theft the rich don t get rich off the backs of the poor and redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit happy or otherwise to believe otherwise is quite literally given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto romantic nonsense i usually agree but when there s a republican in office i feel like they re the biggest believers in the manifesto in reverse create a reserve pool of labor reduce the rights of that proletariat you ve just created with bogus law and order policies concentrate capital in the hands of a few ideally people who can get you reelected and the economy will take care of itself oh and lie use the word compassionate a lot i guess i tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state the basic economic tenet of the republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass the more efficient the rest of us will be and the facts are for most people in the western world are declining standards of living declining benefits disappearing social safety net greater working hours essentially since the entrance of women into the work force not blaming women in any way they have a right to work but its now NUMBER wage earners in each family and still declining standards of living is the reality again to quote that wonderfully liberal document i keep coming back to the cia world factbook on the us economy since NUMBER practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top NUMBER of households owen ,0,8.353048577581443e-278,0

kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldn t pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those

the times december NUMBER NUMBER university boom creates era of sexual tolerance by helen rumbelow the boom in university education has led to a sea change in britain s tolerance of homosexuality according to a report just under half the people now believe that homosexuality is always or mostly wrong down from three quarters NUMBER years ago according to the british social attitudes survey regarded as one of the best indicators of popular opinion that trend is mirrored by the attitude towards ethnic minorities with NUMBER per cent of people now saying they are not at all racially prejudiced compared with NUMBER per cent in NUMBER geoffrey evans a politics professor at oxford university decided to focus on what has caused britain to become more open minded in a report published today the study from the national centre for social research is based on interviews with a cross section of NUMBER NUMBER people young people are much more tolerant than their elders with a quarter of twentysomethings believing that homosexual sex is always wrong compared with two thirds of pensioners but the key to converting a bigot is to send him or her to college with graduates twice as accepting of homosexuals as those with no gcses and a third less racist that transformation happened no matter what social class the student came from and with NUMBER per cent of young people now attending university it was a powerful social effect professor evans said mr blair s famous mantra education education education seems far less consequential now than when first announced in NUMBER as britain struggles with an overburdened health service and the reality that as more and more people get degrees degrees buy less and less he said but the growth of higher education can provide a bulwark against the undermining of liberal democracy through intolerance he added he decided to see whether the tolerance conferred by schooling was just political correctness by testing how many civil rights the educated would give to an unattractive minority white supremacists again people scored higher the longer they had spent at school and university with nearly two thirds of graduates saying that white supremacists should have the right to give television interviews or stand in elections three times as many as those with no qualifications it is not clear why those with higher education are more tolerant the report says adding that it may be simply because university students have increased contact with alternative points of view professor evans also looked at whether the young may grow out of their idealism but found the opposite to be true thirtysomethings were more than twice as likely to say there was nothing wrong with homosexuality as they were when they were in their early twenties he said that as these groups of more educated young people replaced the older generation britain would become an ever more relaxed place soft drugs have also grown in widespread acceptability with more than half the country wanting cannabis to be legalised compared with a third seven years ago that is probably because the use of cannabis is now so widespread with a quarter of those surveyed saying that they had tried it a third of labour voters twice as many as conservatives had tried the drug and being young living in london and having a degree also increased the chances one issue that bucks the trend is hard drugs most take a strong position on heroin that has got stronger over the past seven years now the proportion of people who believe that heroin dealers should always be prosecuted has crept up to NUMBER per cent the views on heroin show that britain is by no means becoming a liberal free for all alison park co director of the study said people are making quite a clear distinction between what they think of as right and wrong on other matters the survey indicates that almost half those questioned think that most of the social security budget goes on unemployment benefits in fact they account for NUMBER per cent that union membership has fallen by a fifth in the past NUMBER years with just under a third of workers in a union and that half those questioned oppose secondary school selection in NUMBER the figure was NUMBER per cent the survey also indicates that NUMBER per cent of men aged between NUMBER and NUMBER live with their parents twice as many as women to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL ,0,3.178956510681758e-96,0

 guido i meant to say that they were NUMBER NUMBER clues cancelled out by NUMBER NUMBER clues but that s wrong too it looks i haven t grokked this part of your code yet this one has way more than NUMBER clues and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more NUMBER NUMBER than NUMBER NUMBER clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly NUMBER NUMBER there s a brief discussion of this before the definition of max_discriminators all clues with prob min_spamprob and max_spamprob are saved in min and max lists and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list whatever remains of the longer list if anything is then fed into the nbest heap too but no more than max_discriminators of them in no case do more than max_discriminators clues enter into the final probability calculation but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues else you d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed in your specific case the excess of clues in the longer max_spamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap and that s why you didn t see anything other than NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER before adding these special lists the outcome when faced with many NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER clues was too often a coin toss whichever flavor just happened to appear max_discriminators NUMBER NUMBER times first determined the final outcome that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i just beat it wink a tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams turned up a low probability very long spam with a list of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues and NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues yikes i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo no matter how often it says zope it gets only one NUMBER NUMBER clue from doing so ditto for zeo in contrast html markup has many unique words that get NUMBER NUMBER btw this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionally independent word probabilities is utterly bogus e g the probability that body appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of br appearing by treating them as independent naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink read the what about html section in URL from the very start i ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at URL and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context i haven t done anything geared toward personal email including the case of non mailing list email that happens to go through URL i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block but as the comment block also says xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited and we ve since done several things that gave significant f n rate reductions i should test that again now are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left almost all of them apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies like content type the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject from x mailer and organization or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there i would need different data yes my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations which i may or may not be able to clean out but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i haven t changed a byte so far and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it in particular i have to skip to and received headers now and i suspect they re going to be very valuable in real life for example i don t even catch undisclosed recipients in the to header now no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora i think it s still corpus size i reported on tests i ran with random samples of NUMBER spams and NUMBER hams from my corpus that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes and while that did harm the error rates the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using NUMBER of each ah a full test run just finished on the tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code tokenize everything in the body lastw for w in word_re findall text n len w make sure this range matches in tokenize_word if NUMBER n NUMBER if w NUMBER s w w NUMBER yield w if lastw yield lastw w lastw w elif n NUMBER lastw for t in tokenize_word w yield t where word_re re compile r w xNUMBER xff this at least doubled the process size over what s done now it helped the f n rate significantly but probably hurt the f p rate the f p rate is too low with only NUMBER hams

if it s not stateful it wouldn t seem to be worth the effort although i guess it might help with ddos attacks sounds snake oilish to me but i m biased by lots of experience with firewalls and proxy servers and the limitations thereof ken original message from rohit khare mailto khare alumni caltech edu sent tuesday august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to fork URL subject datapower announces xml in silicon no analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet but here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xaNUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xgNUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xaNUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xaNUMBER is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first NUMBER bytes of a packet while the xaNUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBERu high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xaNUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may and earlier this month tarari an intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now available priced starting at NUMBER NUMBER the company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises datapower has been

datapower s solutions are based on its patent pending xml generation three xgNUMBER technology enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter and intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type datapower s xml acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of xml that is required to support next generation enterprise applications said eugene kuznetsov cto and founder of datapower technology datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s critical to web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance a single datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of NUMBER servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment in addition the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security protection against xml based denial of service attacks connection of e business
